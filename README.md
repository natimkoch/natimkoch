## Hi there,

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an ecologist focused on different aspects of lichen ecology, mostly community and urban ecology.
I am a postdoc at the University of Minnesota, currently leading a project about the effects of urbanization, mostly landscape and air pollution, on lichens in the state of Minnesota, US.
